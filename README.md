### Crime Compass Prediction

Crime Compass Prediction is a machine learning project that analyzes historical crime data to predict potential high-risk areas. The goal is to help authorities and communities take proactive safety measures based on data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Features

📊 Data Analysis & Visualization – Explore crime patterns and trends over time.

🤖 Crime Prediction Model – Predicts crime-prone areas using machine learning algorithms.

🗺️ Risk Mapping – Visual representation of high, medium, and low-risk zones.

⚙️ End-to-End Pipeline – Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# 🧠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning model building

Flask / Streamlit (optional) – For interactive dashboard or deployment
